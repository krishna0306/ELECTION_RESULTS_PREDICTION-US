Usage
Clone the repository to your local machine.
bash
Copy code
git clone <repository-url>
cd ELECTION_RESULTS_PREDICTION-US
Ensure you have the required CSV files (Trumpall2.csv and Bidenall2.csv) in the project directory.

# _Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python script to perform sentiment analysis on the tweets and predict election results._

bash
Copy code
python election_prediction.py
Sentiment Analysis
Sentiment polarity is used to determine whether a tweet expresses a positive, negative, or neutral sentiment.
Tweets are classified into "positive," "negative," or "neutral" categories based on their sentiment polarity.
Data Cleaning
Neutral tweets are removed from the dataset to balance both datasets.
Prediction
The project predicts election results based on the sentiment analysis of tweets. It analyzes the number of positive and negative sentiments in both candidates' accounts and presents the results in a graphical format.

# Results
_The project's predictions are displayed in a bar chart, comparing the percentage of positive and negative sentiments for both Joe Biden and Donald Trump._
